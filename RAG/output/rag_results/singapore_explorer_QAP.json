Take\nadvantage of the almost-bare streets and loosen up\nyour tie as you embark on an after-work run. Among\nthe cluster of tall buildings, the city centre is also\n\na history-rich area, which has witnessed plenty of\nSingapore's milestones in her road to independence.\n\nUnleash your inner history geek while releasing\nendorphins on this hour-long, 3.25-kilometre heritage\nrunning trail, which takes you around the district to\nuncover architectural gems and prominent heritage\nsites from the colonial era.\n\nStart at Fort Canning Park and breeze past the white\nGothic gates at the entrance to begin the trail. The\nhilltop garden, formerly known as \"Forbidden Hill\", was\nonce home to the ancient Malay rulers of the island\nbefore the British officials transformed it into a fort in\n1860. Warm your muscles up by tackling the sloping\nterrain to reach the former British army barracks at the\ntop. Get charged up as you come face-to-face with one\nof the remaining nine-pound cannons that were used in\nthe past. Run along the designated pathway—there are\nfragments of the fort wall, and a variety of indigenous\nflora, such as the elephant ear fig tree and ear-pod tree.\nA visit to the Battle Box, an old underground bunker,\nwhich functioned as a command centre during the\n\nwar, will serve as a stark, yet important, reminder of the\ncountry’s history during World War II\n\nThere are plenty of museums located in close\nproximity, too, including the National Museum of\nSingapore, Singapore Philatelic Museum and the\nCentral Fire Station. Head down Canning Rise towards\nColeman Street, and make a quick pit stop at the\nnational stamp museum. The building also operates\nas a sub-post office, where you can drop off your mail\nat the only operational colonial postal box left in the\ncountry. For a more memorable moment, pose with\n. the bright, red\ncylinder-shaped\npostbox and take\na selfie.\n\nAfter taking\n| your souvenir\nsnapshot, make\n\nkK\n\na dash towards the War Memorial Park on Beach\nRoad. Located at the centre of the park is the the\nCivilian War Memorial, otherwise recognised as ‘The\nChopsticks’ by locals. The monument honours the\nthousands of civilians who died during the Japanese\nOccupation of Singapore, and the four pillars were\ndesigned to signify the nation's main ethnic groups:\nMalay, Chinese, Indian and Eurasian.\n\nNext, travel west in the direction of St Andrew's Road\ntowards National Gallery Singapore. Pace yourself\n\nso you don’t miss the St Andrew's Cathedral on your\nright. It is the country's largest church and oldest place\nof worship for Anglicans. The institution shows off\n\nthe intricate designs inspired by early English Gothic\narchitecture, featuring high steeples, wide stained glass\nwindows and a grand nave\n\nJust a short distance away is the National Gallery\nSingapore. The two buildings that comprise the gallery\nwere formerly occupied by the Supreme Court and\nCity Hall before they were converted into the majestic\nart landmark you see today. The venue still retains\n\nits historic exterior, especially its famous blue dome.\nMonumental events, such as the surrender of the\nJapanese forces and Singapore's Merdeka speeches,\nalso took place on the very steps of the building's main\nentrance.\n\nTake a breather and stop for more photo ops—head up.\nto the Ng Teng Fong Roof Garden Gallery to get a view\nof the city's Central Business District (CBD) skyline.\n\nContinue your run towards Empress Place, where you\nwill notice more examples of colonial-era structures in\nthe area. Overlooking the Singapore River is the Asian\nCivilisations Museum, which was once known as\n\nthe Government Offices. The museum now houses a\ncollection of ancient artefacts that chart the heritage of\nAsia and Singapore's history as a port city.\n\nA few strides away from the museum stand The Arts\nHouse and Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall. Standing\ntall and gleaming with pride among them is a bronze\nstatue of Sir Stamford Raffles, the founding father of\n\nmodern Singapore.\nBreak your\nmomentum and\nstop for a selfie\nwith the iconic\nlandmark while\nyou're there.\n\nCut your way through Esplanade Park, and be greeted\nwith more tributes to the fallen victims of World War\n\nll. Here stands the Lim Bo Seng Memorial, a pagoda-\nlooking construction with influences from Chinese\nNational style of architecture. It is also the only national\nmonument that commemorates a notable Singapore\nwar hero. Further down the park, you will see The\nCenotaph, which features the engraved names of the\nsoldiers who fought during the war-torn period.\n\nComplete your last lap at Esplanade - Theatres on the\nBay. Apart from being a popular arts hub, the venue\n\nis also often\n\nidentified by its\n\nintriguing roof\n\ndesign—many\n\nlocals draw\n\nsimilarities\n\nto the durian.\n\nTo cool down,\n\nventure to its rooftop terrace where you'll be able to do\nyour stretches and take your post-run selfie against a\nstunning panoramic view of the Marina Bay Sands.\n\nEnd your run by chilling out at the bars and restaurants\nin the area. For a taste of local street food, pop by\nMakansutra Gluttons Bay and replenish your energy\nwith a generous plate of fried carrot cake accompanied\nby a tall, cold glass of sugarcane juice. After eating your\nfill, hang in the area and you might be able to catch a\ncouple of free gigs that's occasionally hosted at the\noutdoor theatre.\n\nFor more interesting trails to explore, go to\nvisitsingapore.com",

It's made\nout of seven subzones, Anson, Cecil, Clifford Pier,\nMaxwell, Phillip, Raffles Place and Tanjong Pagar.\nTanjong Pagar is the first area in Singapore to be\ngazetted under a conservation plan of heritage zones.\nIn recent years, the neighborhood has enjoyed a revival,\nemerging as the epicenter for today's global traveler\nas one of the island's most stylish leisure and dining\nneighborhoods. Among them, Tras Street is lined with\nrestaurants, speakeasies and bars for those in the know.\n\nA long-standing landmark in the heart of the\nCentral Business District, Lau Pa Sat is a long-standing\nlandmark in the heart of the central business district and\nhas witnessed Singapore's ever-changing landscape,\nfrom mudflats to metropolis. The 120-year-old market is\namuch frequented destination for hawker food amidst\nsoaring arches and Victorian era columns.\n\nCHINATOWN\n\nSingapore's historic Chinatown is a bustling mix of old and new, filled with traditional shops and\nmarkets as well as cool stores and cafes. Tea and opera houses, as well as opium dens, were the\nmost popular forms of entertainment back in the olden days, and the Chinatown Street Market\nwas where people congregated to shop, eat and socialise. Yet pockets of history remain in Chinatown, along with\nmore modern sights. You could easily spend a few days wandering through these still-narrow streets. Family-\nrun goldsmiths, medicinal halls and teahouses ply their trades next to sleeker neighbours such as hipster bars.\nand lifestyle shops. Thian Hock Keng temple at Telok Ayer Street is the oldest Chinese temple in Singapore.\nRight along the same street is the Masjid Al-Albrar, one of the earliest mosques in Singapore. Just a few streets\naway at South Bridge Road is the Sri r 7\nMariamman temple, the oldest Hindu\ntemple in the country.\nAmoy Street Food Centre can\nboast as a reputable spot to savour\nsome of the city's street-food staples,\nwith not one, two, or three, but four stalls\nmaking into the list of 2017 Michelin Bib\nGourmand Singapore. How much Bib\nGourmand can you taste in one sitting?\nFor trendier tastes, chic restaurants and\nbars are in Neil Road, Duxton Road and\nKeong Saik Road, with the latter being he 4\nnamed #4 on Lonely Planet must visit places in Asia.

What you might not\nknow: this neighbourhood is as loved for its variety of\nfood options as it is for its architecture. Start by making\na pit stop at the 328 Katong Laksa that offers this\nneighbourhood's most famous signature dish, the Katong\nLaksa, having competed with Gordon Ramsay in 2013\nand won. Stop by The Intan, a living museum dedicated to\nPeranakan culture operated by a lively curator, where by appointment would allow you to immerse into the home of\na Peranakan family, complete with artifacts and food shared over stories of heritage. Discover Peranakan culture as\nyou stroll past heritage shophouses, quaint stores and eateries in this charming corner of eastern Singapore.\nHistoric architecture, cultural diversity, and cult-status eateries are accolades not commonly associated with\nSingapore's Geylang district-which is frequently written off as the island's infamous nightlife zone. But take a stroll\nthrough the meandering lanes and bustling back alleys of this unique enclave, and you'll find a buzzing hub filled\nwith colourful shophouses, mosques, temples, bars and more that put Geylang firmly on the explorer's trail. This is\nas authentic as you can get to local food and culture through hawker centres and illuminated night markets.\n\nWEST\nSINGAPORE\n\nFor those who want to get\naway from — and above - the city and a little\ncloser to nature, the Southern Ridges is a great\nplace to explore. As a bonus, you will also get\none of the best panoramic views of the city,\nharbour and the Southern Islands. The Southern\nRidges is a 10-kilometre stretch of green open\nspaces spanning the hills of some of Singapore's\nmost popular parks and gardens, connected\nby picturesque ridges and pathways. Imagine\nwalking across a bridge 36-metres above the road\nconnecting two hilltops. You can perform this\nexhilarating high-wire act at Henderson Waves,\na distinctive wave-like structure consisting of a\nseries of undulating curved ‘ribs’, also Singapore's\nhighest pedestrian bridge. The Southern Ridges is\nmade up of Mount Faber Park, Telok Blangah Hill\nPark, HortPark, Kent Ridge Park and Labrador\nNature Reserve. Further west takes you to\nSingapore Discovery Centre and the Lee Kong\nChian Natural History Museum.\n\nSENTOSA\n\nSingapore's favourite playground lies in the southern coast where\nyou'll find all the entertainment you need for all ages on this island,\nwhere the fun doesn't cease and boredom retreats. Whether you're\n\nin search of thrills and spills or a relaxed beachside afternoon, you will be spoilt for\n\nchoice at Singapore's favourite leisure destination.\n\nFrom crowd-pleasing attractions like Universal Studios Singapore and\n\nAdventure Cove Waterpark to the magical marine world at the S.E.A Aquarium\n\nat Resorts World™ Sentosa, this bustling island will not disappoint. Beyond the\n\nintegrated resort, soak up the sun on the 3.2km long beach and the many outdoor\n\nfacilities. Test your wits at\n\nthe Skyline Luge or your\n\nwills at Mega Adventure\n\nbefore making a dive at the\n\nindoor skydiving wind tunnel\n\nat iFly Singapore. You can\n\neither take the Singapore\n\nCable Car for a breaktaking\n\nview of the South China Sea\n\nor retreat to Quayside Isle\n\nat Sentosa Cove for a much\n\nneeded respite from the\n\nday's adrenaline rush.\n\nbe",
