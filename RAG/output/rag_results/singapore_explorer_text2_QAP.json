See\nfirst-hand the layers of the rainforest, from the ground\nall the way to the canopy and the emergent layer of\ntrees, when you take on this scenic seven-kilometre-\nlong roundtrip to the bridge. From the carpark at Venus\nDrive, it's a three- to four-hour hike—do note that the\nTreeTop Walk only allows access from one direction.\n\nSouthern Ridges. Keep your camera on hand when\nyou hike the photogenic ten-kilometre-long network of\ntrails known as the Southern Ridges. The route starts\nat HarbourFront Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station and\ntakes you three to five hours to walk through Mount\nFaber Park, Telok Blangah Hill and HortPark before\nending at Kent Ridge Park. Soak in the scenic views\n\nof our skyline and the Southern Islands at the peak of\nMount Faber Park, which is also where you can take\nphotos with the Merlion sculpture—one of seven that\ndot the island. For Instagram-worthy pictures, we\ndefinitely recommend Henderson Waves, the highest\n\npedestrian bridge in Singapore. The post-modern wood\n\nand steel structure's also an ideal venue for a romantic\nnight stroll, as it's majestically illuminated by glowing\nLED lights from 7pm to 7am.\n\nRelive the footsteps of Malay kings and British\ngovernors at Fort Canning Park. This area used to\n\nbe home to Malay royalty, and was also where Sir\nStamford Raffles built his first house, which eventually\nbecame the place of residence for governors. Connect\nwith history when you explore Fort Canning Service\nReservoir to discover landmarks such as the nine-\npound cannon that dates back to the 19th century;\nheadstones that mark the site of Singapore's first\nChristian cemetery; and Fort Gate, a remnant of the\nfortress that was built on this hill.\n\nIN SINGAPO\n\nThe golden hour washing over the city's CBD is a\n\nsight to behold. Skyscrapers glimmer and Marina\n\nBay glistens—it all makes for a postcard-perfect\nbackdrop for your evening run.

Home to some\nof Singapore's most iconic structures (think the\nSingapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by\nthe Bay), it is the ultimate playground for those seeking\nto indulge. Treat yourself to a satisfying meal at one\nof the many celebrity restaurants in Marina Bay Sands\nor end your night by partying at a trendy rooftop club.\nWith the FORMULA 1® race transforming this glittering\nwaterfront venue into the pulsating heart of the action,\nthere really is no better place to be.\n\nDOWNTOWN\nCORE\n\nThe financial heart of Singapore,\n\nDowntown Core houses corporate headquarters and\nfinancial institutions such as the Singapore Exchange\nand is home to the Central Business District. It's made\nout of seven subzones, Anson, Cecil, Clifford Pier,\nMaxwell, Phillip, Raffles Place and Tanjong Pagar.\nTanjong Pagar is the first area in Singapore to be\ngazetted under a conservation plan of heritage zones.\nIn recent years, the neighborhood has enjoyed a revival,\nemerging as the epicenter for today's global traveler\nas one of the island's most stylish leisure and dining\nneighborhoods. Among them, Tras Street is lined with\nrestaurants, speakeasies and bars for those in the know.\n\nA long-standing landmark in the heart of the\nCentral Business District, Lau Pa Sat is a long-standing\nlandmark in the heart of the central business district and\nhas witnessed Singapore's ever-changing landscape,\nfrom mudflats to metropolis. The 120-year-old market is\namuch frequented destination for hawker food amidst\nsoaring arches and Victorian era columns.\n\nCHINATOWN\n\nSingapore's historic Chinatown is a bustling mix of old and new, filled with traditional shops and\nmarkets as well as cool stores and cafes. Tea and opera houses, as well as opium dens, were the\nmost popular forms of entertainment back in the olden days, and the Chinatown Street Market\nwas where people congregated to shop, eat and socialise. Yet pockets of history remain in Chinatown, along with\nmore modern sights. You could easily spend a few days wandering through these still-narrow streets. Family-\nrun goldsmiths, medicinal halls and teahouses ply their trades next to sleeker neighbours such as hipster bars.\nand lifestyle shops. Thian Hock Keng temple at Telok Ayer Street is the oldest Chinese temple in Singapore.\nRight along the same street is the Masjid Al-Albrar, one of the earliest mosques in Singapore. Just a few streets\naway at South Bridge Road is the Sri r 7\nMariamman temple, the oldest Hindu\ntemple in the country.\nAmoy Street Food Centre can\nboast as a reputable spot to savour\nsome of the city's street-food staples,\nwith not one, two, or three, but four stalls\nmaking into the list of 2017 Michelin Bib\nGourmand Singapore. How much Bib\nGourmand can you taste in one sitting?\nFor trendier tastes, chic restaurants and\nbars are in Neil Road, Duxton Road and\nKeong Saik Road, with the latter being he 4\nnamed #4 on Lonely Planet must visit places in Asia. If Clarke Quay is the party central of Singapore, then the\nAnn Siang Hill and Club Street area is its cool, younger cousin — equally fun and always fully charged with an\nelectrifying atmosphere after dark, a favourite with people in the know of the latest nightlife destinations.\n\n» EAST OF SINGAPORE\n\nThe beautiful, historic-rich Joo Chiat/Katong\nneighbourhood is often admired for its colourful rows of\nPeranakan (Straits-born people of Chinese and Malay/\nIndonesian heritage) shophouses. What you might not\nknow: this neighbourhood is as loved for its variety of\nfood options as it is for its architecture. Start by making\na pit stop at the 328 Katong Laksa that offers this\nneighbourhood's most famous signature dish, the Katong\nLaksa, having competed with Gordon Ramsay in 2013\nand won. Stop by The Intan, a living museum dedicated to\nPeranakan culture operated by a lively curator, where by appointment would allow you to immerse into the home of\na Peranakan family, complete with artifacts and food shared over stories of heritage. Discover Peranakan culture as\nyou stroll past heritage shophouses, quaint stores and eateries in this charming corner of eastern Singapore.\nHistoric architecture, cultural diversity, and cult-status eateries are accolades not commonly associated with\nSingapore's Geylang district-which is frequently written off as the island's infamous nightlife zone. But take a stroll\nthrough the meandering lanes and bustling back alleys of this unique enclave, and you'll find a buzzing hub filled\nwith colourful shophouses, mosques, temples, bars and more that put Geylang firmly on the explorer's trail. This is\nas authentic as you can get to local food and culture through hawker centres and illuminated night markets.\n\nWEST\nSINGAPORE\n\nFor those who want to get\naway from — and above - the city and a little\ncloser to nature, the Southern Ridges is a great\nplace to explore. As a bonus, you will also get\none of the best panoramic views of the city,\nharbour and the Southern Islands. The Southern\nRidges is a 10-kilometre stretch of green open\nspaces spanning the hills of some of Singapore's\nmost popular parks and gardens, connected\nby picturesque ridges and pathways. Imagine\nwalking across a bridge 36-metres above the road\nconnecting two hilltops. You can perform this\nexhilarating high-wire act at Henderson Waves,\na distinctive wave-like structure consisting of a\nseries of undulating curved ‘ribs’, also Singapore's\nhighest pedestrian bridge. The Southern Ridges is\nmade up of Mount Faber Park, Telok Blangah Hill\nPark, HortPark, Kent Ridge Park and Labrador\nNature Reserve. Further west takes you to\nSingapore Discovery Centre and the Lee Kong\nChian Natural History Museum.\n\nSENTOSA\n\nSingapore's favourite playground lies in the southern coast where\nyou'll find all the entertainment you need for all ages on this island,\nwhere the fun doesn't cease and boredom retreats. Whether you're\n\nin search of thrills and spills or a relaxed beachside afternoon, you will be spoilt for\n\nchoice at Singapore's favourite leisure destination.\n\nFrom crowd-pleasing attractions like Universal Studios Singapore and\n\nAdventure Cove Waterpark to the magical marine world at the S.E.A Aquarium\n\nat Resorts World™ Sentosa, this bustling island will not disappoint. Beyond the\n\nintegrated resort, soak up the sun on the 3.2km long beach and the many outdoor\n\nfacilities. Test your wits at\n\nthe Skyline Luge or your\n\nwills at Mega Adventure\n\nbefore making a dive at the\n\nindoor skydiving wind tunnel\n\nat iFly Singapore. You can\n\neither take the Singapore\n\nCable Car for a breaktaking\n\nview of the South China Sea\n\nor retreat to Quayside Isle\n\nat Sentosa Cove for a much\n\nneeded respite from the\n\nday's adrenaline rush.\n\nbe",
