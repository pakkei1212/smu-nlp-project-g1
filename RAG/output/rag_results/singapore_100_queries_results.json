Head here for fine museums, national monuments and other\n\ninstitutions, such as art schools and the Central Public Library. One of Singapore's oldest districts,\nBras Basah derived its name from the Malay term for ‘wet rice’ and Sir Stamford Raffles picked the area to be\nthe European center of Singapore Town.

Together with Bras Basah\nBugis district and adjoining into the Civic District, it's the\ncenterpiece of Singapore surrounded by more modern\ntrappings that rise up around it. The district is anchored\nby Fort Canning Park, an iconic hilltop landmark that has\nwitnessed many of Singapore's historical milestones. The\nhill once sited the palaces of 14th century Malay Kings and\nserved as the Headquarters of the Far East Command Centre and British Army Barracks.

Its expansive, sprawling lawns play host to concerts, theatre productions and festivals\nsuch as Shakespeare in the Park, Ballet Under the Stars, and Films at the Fort, while weddings, parties and\ngatherings are a regular sight in the park's venue spaces. Its ancient artefacts are a must-see for history buffs, and\nits lush greenery and expansive lawns offer a variety of arts, heritage and nature experiences. Down the hill, you\ncan trace Singapore's history through stamps at the Singapore Philatelic Museum before stopping for lunch at the\nRaffles Hotel.

It is at this hotel's bar\nwhere the legendary Singapore Sling was created\n\n} THE QUAYS\nON SINGAPORE\nRIVER\n\nConsisting of a trio of Clarke Quay,\nRobertson Quay and Boat Quay, you can literally\nwalk from the mouth of Singapore River through the\nriver valleys along some of the most pristine walking\npaths.

Home to some\nof Singapore's most iconic structures (think the\nSingapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by\nthe Bay), it is the ultimate playground for those seeking\nto indulge. Treat yourself to a satisfying meal at one\nof the many celebrity restaurants in Marina Bay Sands\nor end your night by partying at a trendy rooftop club.\nWith the FORMULA 1® race transforming this glittering\nwaterfront venue into the pulsating heart of the action,\nthere really is no better place to be.\n\nDOWNTOWN\nCORE\n\nThe financial heart of Singapore,\n\nDowntown Core houses corporate headquarters and\nfinancial institutions such as the Singapore Exchange\nand is home to the Central Business District. It's made\nout of seven subzones, Anson, Cecil, Clifford Pier,\nMaxwell, Phillip, Raffles Place and Tanjong Pagar.\nTanjong Pagar is the first area in Singapore to be\ngazetted under a conservation plan of heritage zones.\nIn recent years, the neighborhood has enjoyed a revival,\nemerging as the epicenter for today's global traveler\nas one of the island's most stylish leisure and dining\nneighborhoods. Among them, Tras Street is lined with\nrestaurants, speakeasies and bars for those in the know.\n\nA long-standing landmark in the heart of the\nCentral Business District, Lau Pa Sat is a long-standing\nlandmark in the heart of the central business district and\nhas witnessed Singapore's ever-changing landscape,\nfrom mudflats to metropolis. The 120-year-old market is\namuch frequented destination for hawker food amidst\nsoaring arches and Victorian era columns.\n\nCHINATOWN\n\nSingapore's historic Chinatown is a bustling mix of old and new, filled with traditional shops and\nmarkets as well as cool stores and cafes. Tea and opera houses, as well as opium dens, were the\nmost popular forms of entertainment back in the olden days, and the Chinatown Street Market\nwas where people congregated to shop, eat and socialise. Yet pockets of history remain in Chinatown, along with\nmore modern sights. You could easily spend a few days wandering through these still-narrow streets. Family-\nrun goldsmiths, medicinal halls and teahouses ply their trades next to sleeker neighbours such as hipster bars.\nand lifestyle shops. Thian Hock Keng temple at Telok Ayer Street is the oldest Chinese temple in Singapore.\nRight along the same street is the Masjid Al-Albrar, one of the earliest mosques in Singapore. Just a few streets\naway at South Bridge Road is the Sri r 7\nMariamman temple, the oldest Hindu\ntemple in the country.\nAmoy Street Food Centre can\nboast as a reputable spot to savour\nsome of the city's street-food staples,\nwith not one, two, or three, but four stalls\nmaking into the list of 2017 Michelin Bib\nGourmand Singapore. How much Bib\nGourmand can you taste in one sitting?\nFor trendier tastes, chic restaurants and\nbars are in Neil Road, Duxton Road and\nKeong Saik Road, with the latter being he 4\nnamed #4 on Lonely Planet must visit places in Asia. If Clarke Quay is the party central of Singapore, then the\nAnn Siang Hill and Club Street area is its cool, younger cousin — equally fun and always fully charged with an\nelectrifying atmosphere after dark, a favourite with people in the know of the latest nightlife destinations.\n\n» EAST OF SINGAPORE\n\nThe beautiful, historic-rich Joo Chiat/Katong\nneighbourhood is often admired for its colourful rows of\nPeranakan (Straits-born people of Chinese and Malay/\nIndonesian heritage) shophouses. What you might not\nknow: this neighbourhood is as loved for its variety of\nfood options as it is for its architecture. Start by making\na pit stop at the 328 Katong Laksa that offers this\nneighbourhood's most famous signature dish, the Katong\nLaksa, having competed with Gordon Ramsay in 2013\nand won. Stop by The Intan, a living museum dedicated to\nPeranakan culture operated by a lively curator, where by appointment would allow you to immerse into the home of\na Peranakan family, complete with artifacts and food shared over stories of heritage. Discover Peranakan culture as\nyou stroll past heritage shophouses, quaint stores and eateries in this charming corner of eastern Singapore.\nHistoric architecture, cultural diversity, and cult-status eateries are accolades not commonly associated with\nSingapore's Geylang district-which is frequently written off as the island's infamous nightlife zone. But take a stroll\nthrough the meandering lanes and bustling back alleys of this unique enclave, and you'll find a buzzing hub filled\nwith colourful shophouses, mosques, temples, bars and more that put Geylang firmly on the explorer's trail. This is\nas authentic as you can get to local food and culture through hawker centres and illuminated night markets.\n\nWEST\nSINGAPORE\n\nFor those who want to get\naway from — and above - the city and a little\ncloser to nature, the Southern Ridges is a great\nplace to explore. As a bonus, you will also get\none of the best panoramic views of the city,\nharbour and the Southern Islands. The Southern\nRidges is a 10-kilometre stretch of green open\nspaces spanning the hills of some of Singapore's\nmost popular parks and gardens, connected\nby picturesque ridges and pathways. Imagine\nwalking across a bridge 36-metres above the road\nconnecting two hilltops. You can perform this\nexhilarating high-wire act at Henderson Waves,\na distinctive wave-like structure consisting of a\nseries of undulating curved ‘ribs’, also Singapore's\nhighest pedestrian bridge. The Southern Ridges is\nmade up of Mount Faber Park, Telok Blangah Hill\nPark, HortPark, Kent Ridge Park and Labrador\nNature Reserve. Further west takes you to\nSingapore Discovery Centre and the Lee Kong\nChian Natural History Museum.\n\nSENTOSA\n\nSingapore's favourite playground lies in the southern coast where\nyou'll find all the entertainment you need for all ages on this island,\nwhere the fun doesn't cease and boredom retreats. Whether you're\n\nin search of thrills and spills or a relaxed beachside afternoon, you will be spoilt for\n\nchoice at Singapore's favourite leisure destination.\n\nFrom crowd-pleasing attractions like Universal Studios Singapore and\n\nAdventure Cove Waterpark to the magical marine world at the S.E.A Aquarium\n\nat Resorts World™ Sentosa, this bustling island will not disappoint. Beyond the\n\nintegrated resort, soak up the sun on the 3.2km long beach and the many outdoor\n\nfacilities. Test your wits at\n\nthe Skyline Luge or your\n\nwills at Mega Adventure\n\nbefore making a dive at the\n\nindoor skydiving wind tunnel\n\nat iFly Singapore. You can\n\neither take the Singapore\n\nCable Car for a breaktaking\n\nview of the South China Sea\n\nor retreat to Quayside Isle\n\nat Sentosa Cove for a much\n\nneeded respite from the\n\nday's adrenaline rush.\n\nbe",

        "text": "710 - SCENIC TRAILS TO RUN OR HIKE IN SINGAPORE /\n\nSCENIC TR\n\nMacRitchie Reservoir Park\nPanoramic views of the forest and the thrill of\n\nwalking at 25 metres above ground are all part of the\nexperience when you traverse the TreeTop Walk, a\n250-metre-long freestanding suspension bridge. See\nfirst-hand the layers of the rainforest, from the ground\nall the way to the canopy and the emergent layer of\ntrees, when you take on this scenic seven-kilometre-\nlong roundtrip to the bridge. From the carpark at Venus\nDrive, it's a three- to four-hour hike—do note that the\nTreeTop Walk only allows access from one direction.\n\nSouthern Ridges. Keep your camera on hand when\nyou hike the photogenic ten-kilometre-long network of\ntrails known as the Southern Ridges. The route starts\nat HarbourFront Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station and\ntakes you three to five hours to walk through Mount\nFaber Park, Telok Blangah Hill and HortPark before\nending at Kent Ridge Park. Soak in the scenic views\n\nof our skyline and the Southern Islands at the peak of\nMount Faber Park, which is also where you can take\nphotos with the Merlion sculpture—one of seven that\ndot the island. For Instagram-worthy pictures, we\ndefinitely recommend Henderson Waves, the highest\n\npedestrian bridge in Singapore. The post-modern wood\n\nand steel structure's also an ideal venue for a romantic\nnight stroll, as it's majestically illuminated by glowing\nLED lights from 7pm to 7am.\n\nRelive the footsteps of Malay kings and British\ngovernors at Fort Canning Park. This area used to\n\nbe home to Malay royalty, and was also where Sir\nStamford Raffles built his first house, which eventually\nbecame the place of residence for governors. Connect\nwith history when you explore Fort Canning Service\nReservoir to discover landmarks such as the nine-\npound cannon that dates back to the 19th century;\nheadstones that mark the site of Singapore's first\nChristian cemetery; and Fort Gate, a remnant of the\nfortress that was built on this hill.\n\nIN SINGAPO\n\nThe golden hour washing over the city's CBD is a\n\nsight to behold. Skyscrapers glimmer and Marina\n\nBay glistens—it all makes for a postcard-perfect\nbackdrop for your evening run. The area's proximity\n\nto attractions, restaurants and heritage monuments\nalso means there's plenty to do and see after this\n\neasy 3.9-kilometre route. Start at the Merlion Park\nnext to One Fullerton and you'll run past The Fullerton\nHeritage precinct, across Marina Bay Sands. You can\ncut through the underpass that connects the iconic\ntowers to Gardens by the Bay and whizz pask lakes and\nconservatories before entering the Supertree Grove.\nEnd your run with a last dash towards your final stop,\nthe Marina Barrage where Singapore's skyline lights up\nto celebrate the completion of your run goal.\n\nIf there's one place in Singapore that's synonymous\nwith outdoor revelry, it's East Coast Park, where some\nseven million locals and tourists flock to for the variety\nof sporting, entertainment and dining attractions. Along\nthis 15-kiliometre stretch of beach, you'll find hordes\nof cyclists and roller bladers enjoying the sun and sea\nbreeze, while cable skiing and water sports are on offer\nfor those who prefer wetter pursuits.\n\nSungai Buloh Wetlands Reserve. Enjoy an up-close\nlook at mud lobsters, tree-climbing crabs and monitor\nlizards when you stroll along the 500-metre-long\nboardwalk of the mangrove swamps in Sungei Buloh\nWetland Reserve. The boardwalk runs parallel to the\nWetland Centre. Look to the sky when you head to\n\nthe Migratory Bird Trail just a short walk away. From\nbehind the five hides, two platforms and the 18-metre-\ntall Aerie Tower featured along the trail, you can\n\nquietly observe migratory birds such as the Common\nRedshank and Pacific Golden Plover that shack up in\nthis reserve from September to March. Kingfishers,\nherons and egrets also visit the reserve regularly.\n\nBukit Timah is an expansive twist of roads and\nbuildings, but within the district are tranquil spots for\nsome quiet. Take\na hike up Bukit\nTimah Hill or, for\nthe adventurous,\ngo off-tangent and\nexplore the jungles\nof Bukit Timah\nNature Reserve by\nmountain bike or\nfoot.\n\nPunggol is a little far off from the city centre, but you'll\nbe surprised by the options awaiting you on this end\nof the island. Explore the Punggol Waterway Park\n\nby bicycle—there are scores of rental shops around\noffering hourly rates—or meander the carved paths of\nConey Island.",

See\nfirst-hand the layers of the rainforest, from the ground\nall the way to the canopy and the emergent layer of\ntrees, when you take on this scenic seven-kilometre-\nlong roundtrip to the bridge. From the carpark at Venus\nDrive, it's a three- to four-hour hike—do note that the\nTreeTop Walk only allows access from one direction.\n\nSouthern Ridges. Keep your camera on hand when\nyou hike the photogenic ten-kilometre-long network of\ntrails known as the Southern Ridges. The route starts\nat HarbourFront Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station and\ntakes you three to five hours to walk through Mount\nFaber Park, Telok Blangah Hill and HortPark before\nending at Kent Ridge Park. Soak in the scenic views\n\nof our skyline and the Southern Islands at the peak of\nMount Faber Park, which is also where you can take\nphotos with the Merlion sculpture—one of seven that\ndot the island. For Instagram-worthy pictures, we\ndefinitely recommend Henderson Waves, the highest\n\npedestrian bridge in Singapore. The post-modern wood\n\nand steel structure's also an ideal venue for a romantic\nnight stroll, as it's majestically illuminated by glowing\nLED lights from 7pm to 7am.\n\nRelive the footsteps of Malay kings and British\ngovernors at Fort Canning Park. This area used to\n\nbe home to Malay royalty, and was also where Sir\nStamford Raffles built his first house, which eventually\nbecame the place of residence for governors. Connect\nwith history when you explore Fort Canning Service\nReservoir to discover landmarks such as the nine-\npound cannon that dates back to the 19th century;\nheadstones that mark the site of Singapore's first\nChristian cemetery; and Fort Gate, a remnant of the\nfortress that was built on this hill.\n\nIN SINGAPO\n\nThe golden hour washing over the city's CBD is a\n\nsight to behold. Skyscrapers glimmer and Marina\n\nBay glistens—it all makes for a postcard-perfect\nbackdrop for your evening run. The area's proximity\n\nto attractions, restaurants and heritage monuments\nalso means there's plenty to do and see after this\n\neasy 3.9-kilometre route. Start at the Merlion Park\nnext to One Fullerton and you'll run past The Fullerton\nHeritage precinct, across Marina Bay Sands. You can\ncut through the underpass that connects the iconic\ntowers to Gardens by the Bay and whizz pask lakes and\nconservatories before entering the Supertree Grove.\nEnd your run with a last dash towards your final stop,\nthe Marina Barrage where Singapore's skyline lights up\nto celebrate the completion of your run goal.\n\nIf there's one place in Singapore that's synonymous\nwith outdoor revelry, it's East Coast Park, where some\nseven million locals and tourists flock to for the variety\nof sporting, entertainment and dining attractions. Along\nthis 15-kiliometre stretch of beach, you'll find hordes\nof cyclists and roller bladers enjoying the sun and sea\nbreeze, while cable skiing and water sports are on offer\nfor those who prefer wetter pursuits.\n\nSungai Buloh Wetlands Reserve. Enjoy an up-close\nlook at mud lobsters, tree-climbing crabs and monitor\nlizards when you stroll along the 500-metre-long\nboardwalk of the mangrove swamps in Sungei Buloh\nWetland Reserve. The boardwalk runs parallel to the\nWetland Centre. Look to the sky when you head to\n\nthe Migratory Bird Trail just a short walk away. From\nbehind the five hides, two platforms and the 18-metre-\ntall Aerie Tower featured along the trail, you can\n\nquietly observe migratory birds such as the Common\nRedshank and Pacific Golden Plover that shack up in\nthis reserve from September to March. Kingfishers,\nherons and egrets also visit the reserve regularly.\n\nBukit Timah is an expansive twist of roads and\nbuildings, but within the district are tranquil spots for\nsome quiet. Take\na hike up Bukit\nTimah Hill or, for\nthe adventurous,\ngo off-tangent and\nexplore the jungles\nof Bukit Timah\nNature Reserve by\nmountain bike or\nfoot.\n\nPunggol is a little far off from the city centre, but you'll\nbe surprised by the options awaiting you on this end\nof the island.

Start from the landmark Sultan\nMosque, and wander through the many side streets.\nThe grounds of the former ‘Istana’ (‘palace’) to Sultan\nHussain Mohammed Shah is home to the Malay\n\n103 - A QUICK GUIDE TO SINGAPORE’S DISTRICTS /\n\nhistory and culture better. Wander the streets and you'll\nsoon uncover Haji Lane, a row of multi-label stores,\nquirky boutiques as well as hip bars and cafes. Or pick\nup traditional wares such as Persian carpets, kebaya\ndresses and handmade perfumes from Arab Street and\nBussorah Street. The nasi padang (Indonesian dishes\nflavoured with spices and served with rice) at Hjh\nMaimunah is famous among locals. Café and boutique\nMaison Ikkoku on Kandahar Street offers tasty\nmodern grub, and also houses an excellent rooftop\n\nHeritage Centre, where you can get to know Malay cocktail bar.\n\nJALAN BESAR,\nROCHER,\nLAVENDER\n\nNow a conserved area, Jalan Besar is home\nto an eclectic range of eateries, cafés, entertainment\nvenues, and religious sites. It's also a hostel hotspot,\nand backpackers constantly flock here. Beyond the\nneon lights of bars and lounges, Jalan Besar is rife with\nhip cafés that are now calling the neighbourhood's\nmany shophouses home. You can easily spend an\nentire afternoon hopping from one spot to another\nsuch as Chye Seng Huat Hardware, all while tucking\ninto hearty brunch plates, classic French pastries and\nmodern takes on local cuisine such as Non Entrée\nDesserts. The district is also making a name for itself\nas a haven for Third Wave coffee, so you will have\nplenty of fuel for your trip.\n\nTHE CIVIC\nDISTRICT\n\nThe Civic District is where Singapore's\nhistorical, architectural and cultural heritage started.\nLocated right at the mouth of the Singapore River, the\nCivic District is at the heart of the city's past, with key\nlandmarks from prominent historical figures such as Sir\nStamford Raffles, the man who founded Singapore, to\nup-and-coming architectural icons of the 21st century.\nAmong key historical landmarks include St Andrew's\nCathedral, National Gallery Singapore which comprises\nthe historical Supreme Court and City Hall, Padang,\nthe Asian Civilisations Museum, The Arts House (Old\nParliament House) and Victoria Theatre, overlooking the\nmagnificent Fullerton Hotel and Esplanade - Theatres\non the Bay which locals affectionately call \"the durian”.\n\nBRAS BASAH BUGIS\n\nBras Basah.Bugis Precinct is where to go for a slice of Singapore's rich heritage, preserved\n\narchitecture and palpable energy. Head here for fine museums, national monuments and other\n\ninstitutions, such as art schools and the Central Public Library. One of Singapore's oldest districts,\nBras Basah derived its name from the Malay term for ‘wet rice’ and Sir Stamford Raffles picked the area to be\nthe European center of Singapore Town. The adjacent Bugis Street, named after the seafaring Bugis people\nfrom Indonesia who came here to trade with local merchants, has a less pristine past. You could spend days\njust soaking in the vibe of this buzzing district. The district is home to museums such as the National Museum\nof Singapore, The Singapore Art Museum and Peranakan Museum, and national monuments like the Armenian\nChurch and Central Fire Station, Singapore's oldest fire station. Explore CHIJMES, an enclave of restaurants and\nbars in the middle of the city. The former chapel and school with its green lawns, marble waterfalls, courtyards\nand neoclassical buildings — harks back to a bygone, more gracious age. A thriving district with a colourful past,\nit now boasts everything shoppers could ever ask for; malls such as Bugis+ and Bugis Junction, charming\nboutiques, bustling street markets, and of course, bargains at every corner.\n\nTHE COLONIAL\nDISTRICT\n\nSingapore's Colonial District is peppered with\nreminders of British colonial rule. Together with Bras Basah\nBugis district and adjoining into the Civic District, it's the\ncenterpiece of Singapore surrounded by more modern\ntrappings that rise up around it. The district is anchored\nby Fort Canning Park, an iconic hilltop landmark that has\nwitnessed many of Singapore's historical milestones.

See\nfirst-hand the layers of the rainforest, from the ground\nall the way to the canopy and the emergent layer of\ntrees, when you take on this scenic seven-kilometre-\nlong roundtrip to the bridge. From the carpark at Venus\nDrive, it's a three- to four-hour hike—do note that the\nTreeTop Walk only allows access from one direction.\n\nSouthern Ridges. Keep your camera on hand when\nyou hike the photogenic ten-kilometre-long network of\ntrails known as the Southern Ridges. The route starts\nat HarbourFront Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station and\ntakes you three to five hours to walk through Mount\nFaber Park, Telok Blangah Hill and HortPark before\nending at Kent Ridge Park. Soak in the scenic views\n\nof our skyline and the Southern Islands at the peak of\nMount Faber Park, which is also where you can take\nphotos with the Merlion sculpture—one of seven that\ndot the island. For Instagram-worthy pictures, we\ndefinitely recommend Henderson Waves, the highest\n\npedestrian bridge in Singapore. The post-modern wood\n\nand steel structure's also an ideal venue for a romantic\nnight stroll, as it's majestically illuminated by glowing\nLED lights from 7pm to 7am.\n\nRelive the footsteps of Malay kings and British\ngovernors at Fort Canning Park. This area used to\n\nbe home to Malay royalty, and was also where Sir\nStamford Raffles built his first house, which eventually\nbecame the place of residence for governors. Connect\nwith history when you explore Fort Canning Service\nReservoir to discover landmarks such as the nine-\npound cannon that dates back to the 19th century;\nheadstones that mark the site of Singapore's first\nChristian cemetery; and Fort Gate, a remnant of the\nfortress that was built on this hill.\n\nIN SINGAPO\n\nThe golden hour washing over the city's CBD is a\n\nsight to behold. Skyscrapers glimmer and Marina\n\nBay glistens—it all makes for a postcard-perfect\nbackdrop for your evening run. The area's proximity\n\nto attractions, restaurants and heritage monuments\nalso means there's plenty to do and see after this\n\neasy 3.9-kilometre route. Start at the Merlion Park\nnext to One Fullerton and you'll run past The Fullerton\nHeritage precinct, across Marina Bay Sands. You can\ncut through the underpass that connects the iconic\ntowers to Gardens by the Bay and whizz pask lakes and\nconservatories before entering the Supertree Grove.\nEnd your run with a last dash towards your final stop,\nthe Marina Barrage where Singapore's skyline lights up\nto celebrate the completion of your run goal.\n\nIf there's one place in Singapore that's synonymous\nwith outdoor revelry, it's East Coast Park, where some\nseven million locals and tourists flock to for the variety\nof sporting, entertainment and dining attractions. Along\nthis 15-kiliometre stretch of beach, you'll find hordes\nof cyclists and roller bladers enjoying the sun and sea\nbreeze, while cable skiing and water sports are on offer\nfor those who prefer wetter pursuits.\n\nSungai Buloh Wetlands Reserve. Enjoy an up-close\nlook at mud lobsters, tree-climbing crabs and monitor\nlizards when you stroll along the 500-metre-long\nboardwalk of the mangrove swamps in Sungei Buloh\nWetland Reserve. The boardwalk runs parallel to the\nWetland Centre. Look to the sky when you head to\n\nthe Migratory Bird Trail just a short walk away. From\nbehind the five hides, two platforms and the 18-metre-\ntall Aerie Tower featured along the trail, you can\n\nquietly observe migratory birds such as the Common\nRedshank and Pacific Golden Plover that shack up in\nthis reserve from September to March. Kingfishers,\nherons and egrets also visit the reserve regularly.\n\nBukit Timah is an expansive twist of roads and\nbuildings, but within the district are tranquil spots for\nsome quiet. Take\na hike up Bukit\nTimah Hill or, for\nthe adventurous,\ngo off-tangent and\nexplore the jungles\nof Bukit Timah\nNature Reserve by\nmountain bike or\nfoot.\n\nPunggol is a little far off from the city centre, but you'll\nbe surprised by the options awaiting you on this end\nof the island. Explore the Punggol Waterway Park\n\nby bicycle—there are scores of rental shops around\noffering hourly rates—or meander the carved paths of\nConey Island.",

See\nfirst-hand the layers of the rainforest, from the ground\nall the way to the canopy and the emergent layer of\ntrees, when you take on this scenic seven-kilometre-\nlong roundtrip to the bridge. From the carpark at Venus\nDrive, it's a three- to four-hour hike—do note that the\nTreeTop Walk only allows access from one direction.\n\nSouthern Ridges. Keep your camera on hand when\nyou hike the photogenic ten-kilometre-long network of\ntrails known as the Southern Ridges. The route starts\nat HarbourFront Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station and\ntakes you three to five hours to walk through Mount\nFaber Park, Telok Blangah Hill and HortPark before\nending at Kent Ridge Park. Soak in the scenic views\n\nof our skyline and the Southern Islands at the peak of\nMount Faber Park, which is also where you can take\nphotos with the Merlion sculpture—one of seven that\ndot the island. For Instagram-worthy pictures, we\ndefinitely recommend Henderson Waves, the highest\n\npedestrian bridge in Singapore. The post-modern wood\n\nand steel structure's also an ideal venue for a romantic\nnight stroll, as it's majestically illuminated by glowing\nLED lights from 7pm to 7am.\n\nRelive the footsteps of Malay kings and British\ngovernors at Fort Canning Park. This area used to\n\nbe home to Malay royalty, and was also where Sir\nStamford Raffles built his first house, which eventually\nbecame the place of residence for governors. Connect\nwith history when you explore Fort Canning Service\nReservoir to discover landmarks such as the nine-\npound cannon that dates back to the 19th century;\nheadstones that mark the site of Singapore's first\nChristian cemetery; and Fort Gate, a remnant of the\nfortress that was built on this hill.\n\nIN SINGAPO\n\nThe golden hour washing over the city's CBD is a\n\nsight to behold. Skyscrapers glimmer and Marina\n\nBay glistens—it all makes for a postcard-perfect\nbackdrop for your evening run. The area's proximity\n\nto attractions, restaurants and heritage monuments\nalso means there's plenty to do and see after this\n\neasy 3.9-kilometre route. Start at the Merlion Park\nnext to One Fullerton and you'll run past The Fullerton\nHeritage precinct, across Marina Bay Sands. You can\ncut through the underpass that connects the iconic\ntowers to Gardens by the Bay and whizz pask lakes and\nconservatories before entering the Supertree Grove.\nEnd your run with a last dash towards your final stop,\nthe Marina Barrage where Singapore's skyline lights up\nto celebrate the completion of your run goal.\n\nIf there's one place in Singapore that's synonymous\nwith outdoor revelry, it's East Coast Park, where some\nseven million locals and tourists flock to for the variety\nof sporting, entertainment and dining attractions. Along\nthis 15-kiliometre stretch of beach, you'll find hordes\nof cyclists and roller bladers enjoying the sun and sea\nbreeze, while cable skiing and water sports are on offer\nfor those who prefer wetter pursuits.\n\nSungai Buloh Wetlands Reserve. Enjoy an up-close\nlook at mud lobsters, tree-climbing crabs and monitor\nlizards when you stroll along the 500-metre-long\nboardwalk of the mangrove swamps in Sungei Buloh\nWetland Reserve. The boardwalk runs parallel to the\nWetland Centre. Look to the sky when you head to\n\nthe Migratory Bird Trail just a short walk away. From\nbehind the five hides, two platforms and the 18-metre-\ntall Aerie Tower featured along the trail, you can\n\nquietly observe migratory birds such as the Common\nRedshank and Pacific Golden Plover that shack up in\nthis reserve from September to March. Kingfishers,\nherons and egrets also visit the reserve regularly.\n\nBukit Timah is an expansive twist of roads and\nbuildings, but within the district are tranquil spots for\nsome quiet. Take\na hike up Bukit\nTimah Hill or, for\nthe adventurous,\ngo off-tangent and\nexplore the jungles\nof Bukit Timah\nNature Reserve by\nmountain bike or\nfoot.\n\nPunggol is a little far off from the city centre, but you'll\nbe surprised by the options awaiting you on this end\nof the island. Explore the Punggol Waterway Park\n\nby bicycle—there are scores of rental shops around\noffering hourly rates—or meander the carved paths of\nConey Island.",

Start from the landmark Sultan\nMosque, and wander through the many side streets.\nThe grounds of the former ‘Istana’ (‘palace’) to Sultan\nHussain Mohammed Shah is home to the Malay\n\n103 - A QUICK GUIDE TO SINGAPORE’S DISTRICTS /\n\nhistory and culture better. Wander the streets and you'll\nsoon uncover Haji Lane, a row of multi-label stores,\nquirky boutiques as well as hip bars and cafes. Or pick\nup traditional wares such as Persian carpets, kebaya\ndresses and handmade perfumes from Arab Street and\nBussorah Street. The nasi padang (Indonesian dishes\nflavoured with spices and served with rice) at Hjh\nMaimunah is famous among locals. Café and boutique\nMaison Ikkoku on Kandahar Street offers tasty\nmodern grub, and also houses an excellent rooftop\n\nHeritage Centre, where you can get to know Malay cocktail bar.\n\nJALAN BESAR,\nROCHER,\nLAVENDER\n\nNow a conserved area, Jalan Besar is home\nto an eclectic range of eateries, cafés, entertainment\nvenues, and religious sites. It's also a hostel hotspot,\nand backpackers constantly flock here. Beyond the\nneon lights of bars and lounges, Jalan Besar is rife with\nhip cafés that are now calling the neighbourhood's\nmany shophouses home. You can easily spend an\nentire afternoon hopping from one spot to another\nsuch as Chye Seng Huat Hardware, all while tucking\ninto hearty brunch plates, classic French pastries and\nmodern takes on local cuisine such as Non Entrée\nDesserts. The district is also making a name for itself\nas a haven for Third Wave coffee, so you will have\nplenty of fuel for your trip.\n\nTHE CIVIC\nDISTRICT\n\nThe Civic District is where Singapore's\nhistorical, architectural and cultural heritage started.\nLocated right at the mouth of the Singapore River, the\nCivic District is at the heart of the city's past, with key\nlandmarks from prominent historical figures such as Sir\nStamford Raffles, the man who founded Singapore, to\nup-and-coming architectural icons of the 21st century.\nAmong key historical landmarks include St Andrew's\nCathedral, National Gallery Singapore which comprises\nthe historical Supreme Court and City Hall, Padang,\nthe Asian Civilisations Museum, The Arts House (Old\nParliament House) and Victoria Theatre, overlooking the\nmagnificent Fullerton Hotel and Esplanade - Theatres\non the Bay which locals affectionately call \"the durian”.\n\nBRAS BASAH BUGIS\n\nBras Basah.Bugis Precinct is where to go for a slice of Singapore's rich heritage, preserved\n\narchitecture and palpable energy. Head here for fine museums, national monuments and other\n\ninstitutions, such as art schools and the Central Public Library. One of Singapore's oldest districts,\nBras Basah derived its name from the Malay term for ‘wet rice’ and Sir Stamford Raffles picked the area to be\nthe European center of Singapore Town. The adjacent Bugis Street, named after the seafaring Bugis people\nfrom Indonesia who came here to trade with local merchants, has a less pristine past. You could spend days\njust soaking in the vibe of this buzzing district. The district is home to museums such as the National Museum\nof Singapore, The Singapore Art Museum and Peranakan Museum, and national monuments like the Armenian\nChurch and Central Fire Station, Singapore's oldest fire station. Explore CHIJMES, an enclave of restaurants and\nbars in the middle of the city. The former chapel and school with its green lawns, marble waterfalls, courtyards\nand neoclassical buildings — harks back to a bygone, more gracious age. A thriving district with a colourful past,\nit now boasts everything shoppers could ever ask for; malls such as Bugis+ and Bugis Junction, charming\nboutiques, bustling street markets, and of course, bargains at every corner.\n\nTHE COLONIAL\nDISTRICT\n\nSingapore's Colonial District is peppered with\nreminders of British colonial rule. Together with Bras Basah\nBugis district and adjoining into the Civic District, it's the\ncenterpiece of Singapore surrounded by more modern\ntrappings that rise up around it. The district is anchored\nby Fort Canning Park, an iconic hilltop landmark that has\nwitnessed many of Singapore's historical milestones. The\nhill once sited the palaces of 14th century Malay Kings and\nserved as the Headquarters of the Far East Command Centre and British Army Barracks. Today, Fort Canning Park\nis a venue for celebrations. Its expansive, sprawling lawns play host to concerts, theatre productions and festivals\nsuch as Shakespeare in the Park, Ballet Under the Stars, and Films at the Fort, while weddings, parties and\ngatherings are a regular sight in the park's venue spaces. Its ancient artefacts are a must-see for history buffs, and\nits lush greenery and expansive lawns offer a variety of arts, heritage and nature experiences. Down the hill, you\ncan trace Singapore's history through stamps at the Singapore Philatelic Museum before stopping for lunch at the\nRaffles Hotel. Raffles Hotel was the crown of colonial indulgence with a reputation of luxury. It is at this hotel's bar\nwhere the legendary Singapore Sling was created\n\n} THE QUAYS\nON SINGAPORE\nRIVER\n\nConsisting of a trio of Clarke Quay,\nRobertson Quay and Boat Quay, you can literally\nwalk from the mouth of Singapore River through the\nriver valleys along some of the most pristine walking\npaths. Shophouses along Boat Quay that used to\nbe the centre of trade has now been conserved and\nadapted for modern use, offering up various bars,\n‘ pubs and restaurants. Warehouses along Clarke\nQuay are today Iconic dance clubs and live music\nvenues, rooftop bars, creating trendy nightspots for heart-pumping entertainment. Together, both Clarke Quay and\nBoat Quay is a must-have stop for the city's most lively nightlife spots. As you move further inwards, Robertson Quay\noffers a more quiet respite, with locals often seen running along its banks. The area combines upperclass residential\napartments with designer hotels such as M Social and The Warehouse Hotel with wonderful choices of gastronomic\noptions that would satisfy any foodie.",

Start from the landmark Sultan\nMosque, and wander through the many side streets.\nThe grounds of the former ‘Istana’ (‘palace’) to Sultan\nHussain Mohammed Shah is home to the Malay\n\n103 - A QUICK GUIDE TO SINGAPORE’S DISTRICTS /\n\nhistory and culture better. Wander the streets and you'll\nsoon uncover Haji Lane, a row of multi-label stores,\nquirky boutiques as well as hip bars and cafes. Or pick\nup traditional wares such as Persian carpets, kebaya\ndresses and handmade perfumes from Arab Street and\nBussorah Street. The nasi padang (Indonesian dishes\nflavoured with spices and served with rice) at Hjh\nMaimunah is famous among locals. Café and boutique\nMaison Ikkoku on Kandahar Street offers tasty\nmodern grub, and also houses an excellent rooftop\n\nHeritage Centre, where you can get to know Malay cocktail bar.\n\nJALAN BESAR,\nROCHER,\nLAVENDER\n\nNow a conserved area, Jalan Besar is home\nto an eclectic range of eateries, cafés, entertainment\nvenues, and religious sites. It's also a hostel hotspot,\nand backpackers constantly flock here. Beyond the\nneon lights of bars and lounges, Jalan Besar is rife with\nhip cafés that are now calling the neighbourhood's\nmany shophouses home. You can easily spend an\nentire afternoon hopping from one spot to another\nsuch as Chye Seng Huat Hardware, all while tucking\ninto hearty brunch plates, classic French pastries and\nmodern takes on local cuisine such as Non Entrée\nDesserts. The district is also making a name for itself\nas a haven for Third Wave coffee, so you will have\nplenty of fuel for your trip.\n\nTHE CIVIC\nDISTRICT\n\nThe Civic District is where Singapore's\nhistorical, architectural and cultural heritage started.\nLocated right at the mouth of the Singapore River, the\nCivic District is at the heart of the city's past, with key\nlandmarks from prominent historical figures such as Sir\nStamford Raffles, the man who founded Singapore, to\nup-and-coming architectural icons of the 21st century.\nAmong key historical landmarks include St Andrew's\nCathedral, National Gallery Singapore which comprises\nthe historical Supreme Court and City Hall, Padang,\nthe Asian Civilisations Museum, The Arts House (Old\nParliament House) and Victoria Theatre, overlooking the\nmagnificent Fullerton Hotel and Esplanade - Theatres\non the Bay which locals affectionately call \"the durian”.\n\nBRAS BASAH BUGIS\n\nBras Basah.Bugis Precinct is where to go for a slice of Singapore's rich heritage, preserved\n\narchitecture and palpable energy. Head here for fine museums, national monuments and other\n\ninstitutions, such as art schools and the Central Public Library. One of Singapore's oldest districts,\nBras Basah derived its name from the Malay term for ‘wet rice’ and Sir Stamford Raffles picked the area to be\nthe European center of Singapore Town. The adjacent Bugis Street, named after the seafaring Bugis people\nfrom Indonesia who came here to trade with local merchants, has a less pristine past. You could spend days\njust soaking in the vibe of this buzzing district. The district is home to museums such as the National Museum\nof Singapore, The Singapore Art Museum and Peranakan Museum, and national monuments like the Armenian\nChurch and Central Fire Station, Singapore's oldest fire station.

The former chapel and school with its green lawns, marble waterfalls, courtyards\nand neoclassical buildings — harks back to a bygone, more gracious age. A thriving district with a colourful past,\nit now boasts everything shoppers could ever ask for; malls such as Bugis+ and Bugis Junction, charming\nboutiques, bustling street markets, and of course, bargains at every corner.\n\nTHE COLONIAL\nDISTRICT\n\nSingapore's Colonial District is peppered with\nreminders of British colonial rule. Together with Bras Basah\nBugis district and adjoining into the Civic District, it's the\ncenterpiece of Singapore surrounded by more modern\ntrappings that rise up around it. The district is anchored\nby Fort Canning Park, an iconic hilltop landmark that has\nwitnessed many of Singapore's historical milestones. The\nhill once sited the palaces of 14th century Malay Kings and\nserved as the Headquarters of the Far East Command Centre and British Army Barracks. Today, Fort Canning Park\nis a venue for celebrations. Its expansive, sprawling lawns play host to concerts, theatre productions and festivals\nsuch as Shakespeare in the Park, Ballet Under the Stars, and Films at the Fort, while weddings, parties and\ngatherings are a regular sight in the park's venue spaces. Its ancient artefacts are a must-see for history buffs, and\nits lush greenery and expansive lawns offer a variety of arts, heritage and nature experiences. Down the hill, you\ncan trace Singapore's history through stamps at the Singapore Philatelic Museum before stopping for lunch at the\nRaffles Hotel. Raffles Hotel was the crown of colonial indulgence with a reputation of luxury. It is at this hotel's bar\nwhere the legendary Singapore Sling was created\n\n} THE QUAYS\nON SINGAPORE\nRIVER\n\nConsisting of a trio of Clarke Quay,\nRobertson Quay and Boat Quay, you can literally\nwalk from the mouth of Singapore River through the\nriver valleys along some of the most pristine walking\npaths.
