      "\n",
      "1. **Singapore Botanic Gardens**: Start your trip with a visit to Singapore's oldest garden, the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Explore the National Orchid Garden, which is home to a large display of orchids, and the National Tropical Botanic Garden, which offers a variety of tropical plants. The gardens are perfect for a leisurely stroll and a peaceful escape from the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Gardens by the Bay**: After your visit to the Botanic Gardens, head to Gardens by the Bay. This is a quick getaway to some serious greenery, featuring two conservatories, the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. The Cloud Forest is a cool-moist conservatory with a 35m-tall mountain covered in plants such as orchids, and the Flower Dome replicates a cool-dry climate with plants from the Mediterranean region. The Flower Field is also worth visiting, where the displays change regularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Little Explorers Nature Park**: After your visit to Gardens by the Bay, head to Little Explorers Nature Park. This is a great place to explore nature and learn about the local wildlife. You can also take a tour with Subaraj Rajathurai, a nature tour evangelist, who will take you into the untamed areas of Singapore to experience the ecosystems that he has fought to preserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Sentosa Island**: For a more adventurous option, head to Sentosa Island. This is Singapore's largest island and offers a variety of attractions, including Universal Studios Singapore, Adventure Cove Waterpark, and the Skyline Luge. You can also relax at the beach or take a stroll along the boardwalk.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Changi Point Ferry Terminal**: For a unique experience, take a bumboat at Changi Point Ferry Terminal and explore Pulau Ubin Botanic Garden.
